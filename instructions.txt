1. Please code a small “Hello World” web-application in a language of your choice and
put it into a runnable docker container.
2. Create a new repository on your favorite git platform which will hold both the
application code from above and the infrastructure code below, as well as the CI/CD
configuration.
3. Please contribute terraform code to …
a. … create an AWS K8S cluster
b. … create an amazon ECR repository
c. … required IAM setup
4. Set up a CI/CD workflow (= Github Actions? Gitlab CI? …?) that
a. … is triggered on every push to the main branch of the repository
b. … builds the docker image & pushes it to the ECR
c. … deploys the docker image to the EKS cluster once the image is built and
pushed
d. … publicly exposes the updated application in the cluster, so we can see the
“Hello World” output.
